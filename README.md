**I tried to add controller usage to select crates but it broke eye tracking and I couldn't fix it, it should be easy enough to just have the participant say which crate they think is correct and record the data that way**

Make sure to run the pylsl code in assets/shellgame/scripts before starting to record eye tracking. It will record to a csv file in the same location.
